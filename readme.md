The Ningxia Potential Landslide Hazard Dataset (NXPLHD) are created by the Geohazard Research Group from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University. The dataset consists of 313 sets of potential landslide images and 1039 sets of non-landslide images. For the potential landslide samples, we provide the satellite optical images(*.tif), the shapefiles of potential landslides (mask files, *.tif), the corresponding digital elevation models data (DEM, *.tif), and the attribute information of potential landslides (attribute.xlsx). For the non-landslide samples, the images and the corresponding DEM data are provided. The non-landslide samples cover various scenes such as cultivated land, mountain ridges, cloud cover, snow cover, roads, lakes, vegetation, factories, and so on. All the potential landslide and non-landslide samples are cropped from the GF2 satellite images captured in early 2020, which has a spatial resolution of 1m. The DEM has a spatial resolution of 30m.
